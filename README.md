Hello, my name is Dima and I enjoy creating websites and web applications! I strive to produce high-quality, visually appealing, and functional results, with the most important goal of ensuring a pleasant user experience. I became interested in web development a year ago when I attempted to code my first website. Since then, I have been studying markup languages and I am currently actively learning other technologies!

Skills: JavaScript (ES6+) / React / Redux Toolkit / Typescript / Next.js / Tailwind CSS
